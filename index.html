        The main goal of doing so is to allow you to commit and upload sections of any future tutorial to git in order to revisit examples that you had constructed previously.

            <ul>
            <li>You have to learn git eventually</li>
            <li>Learning git sooner rather than later would allow you to help solidify the learning you do with git and help learn concepts that you'll be learning in the tutorials by being able to see different iterations of the same code.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
        This would be useful because sometimes during tutorials it will be demonstrated how to do something several ways, or it will demonstrate how to do something poorly vs how to do things better. It can be useful to have both examples to read off of in order to see how they're similar and what they each do differently.
